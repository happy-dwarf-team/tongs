# Tongs — design

Status: draft 2 (2026-10-16): layer 1 (state) and the key part of layer 2
(input) implemented.

## Goal

Let a test agent control and observe a running game through commands with a
verifiable answer, instead of screenshots and pixel coordinates. Every command
returns the state read from the game after it ran.

Layers, cheapest first:

1. **State (0.1.0):** date, speed, pause. Read-only.
2. **Input:** inject keyboard/mouse events into the game's own SDL event queue
   (`SDL_PushEvent` is linked statically into `eu4.exe`), so shortcuts work
   without focusing the window. Commands such as `pause`, `resume`, `speed N`,
   `key`, each answered with the state after the action. Keys are
   implemented; mouse events are not.
3. **Widgets by name:** find GUI elements by their `.gui` names, click them and
   read their text. Only if layer 2 is not enough.

Actions go through the same path as a player's input, never by writing game
state directly, so the game behaves as it would for a human player.

## Transport

- Named pipe `\\.\pipe\tongs`, one instance, created with
  `FILE_FLAG_FIRST_PIPE_INSTANCE` (a second game cannot take it over and logs
  an error instead), `PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS`, and a DACL that allows only
  the user running the game and SYSTEM.
- One client at a time; requests are lines, answers are single-line JSON.
- Off unless `enabled = true` in `anvil/data/tongs/config.toml`; the input
  commands also need `input = true`.

## State reading (EU4 1.37.5)

Found with Ghidra and confirmed on a running game in the lab repository
(`docs/reverse-engineering.md`, "Stan pauzy"). RVAs relative to `eu4.exe`.

| Value | Where |
| --- | --- |
| root object | pointer at `0x233FE78` |
| current date | `int32` at `root + 0x1DD0` |
| speed | `int32` at `root + 0x1E08`, 0–4 (UI shows +1); keeps its value while paused |
| session | pointer at `root + 0x1E00`, vtable `0x1CB8460`; slot `0x100` (`0x8024D0`) returns `session + 0x418` |
| game-speed object | pointer at `session + 0x418` |
| player pause | byte at `game_speed + 0x48` |
| is paused | `0x7E01B0(game_speed)`: the pause byte, or in single player a non-empty list at `+0x00` |

The date is the number of hours since 1 January of year −5000 in 365-day years
(no leap days): `0x14C7890` formats it and `0xCFD70` computes the year as
`floor((raw − 43 800 000) / 24 / 365)`. `src/game_date.cpp` decodes it; the top
bar refreshes `DateText` whenever the value changes.

`plugin.toml` declares the code that relies on these offsets as `[[expect]]`
entries, so Anvil skips the plugin when any of them differs.

### Threading

The pipe thread reads game memory while the main thread runs the game. Reads
are word-sized and guarded by SEH; while a save is loading or the game is
quitting, objects may be in transition and `state` answers `in_game: false`
or a read error rather than crashing. Calling `0x7E01B0` from the pipe thread
is read-only (it reads the pause byte and the session's multiplayer state).
Input commands also run on the pipe thread: they only queue SDL events
(see "Input"), and the main thread handles them.

## Live check (2026-10-16)

EU4 1.37.5 (original `eu4.exe`), Anvil 0.2.0, this plugin 0.1.0, Russia save
of 17 March 1719 loaded with `continue=`; the lab's `anvil-play.ps1 -Scenario
control`, `state` polled once a second:

- Anvil: all 5 `[[expect]]` ranges matched, plugin loaded with 0 patches, pipe
  served 43 ms after Anvil started.
- During loading: `in_game: false`, first "session is null", then for a few
  seconds "session object has an unexpected vtable" (another class sits at
  `root + 0x1E00` while loading).
- Loaded: `date_raw` 58 860 240 = `1719.3.17`; the game paused itself about a
  second after the first `in_game: true` answer.
- Unpaused at UI speed 4: the date advanced ~5 days per poll (24 per day), the
  month changed correctly (28 March → 1 April), `paused` and `paused_flag`
  switched together; after pausing the date stopped. Speed changes while
  paused were reported as well.

## Input (EU4 1.37.5, SDL 2.0.4)

Found with `dumpbin /disasm` in the lab repository and checked on a running
game (below). RVAs relative to `eu4.exe`; `plugin.toml` checks the code.

- `eu4.exe` links SDL 2.0.4 statically (source paths
  `SDL2-2.0.4\src\...`) with its dynamic API: each `SDL_*` function is a
  `jmp [slot]` into a table of 553 pointers at `0x1FB0000` (size `0x1148`),
  which `SDL_DYNAPI_entry` (`0x17320F0`) fills in the order of
  `src/dynapi/SDL_dynapi_procs.h`. Slot 80 is `SDL_PeepEvents` (`0x17467A0`,
  the only user of "The event system has been shut down"), slot 88
  `SDL_PushEvent` (`0x1746B90`, slot `0x1FB02C0`, thunk `0x1735420`), slot 444
  `SDL_GetTicks`. The game itself calls `SDL_PushEvent` once, to post
  `SDL_QUIT` (`0x156AC80`).
- `PressKey` checks that the slot points to `0x1746B90` (it does not before
  SDL starts, or with `SDL_DYNAMIC_API` set) and calls it. `SDL_PushEvent`
  locks the event queue, so the pipe thread may call it. The game's code calls
  none of the event filter and watch functions (slots 89–92); a filter
  would run on the pipe thread.
- The game's event loop `0x1569C70` polls with `SDL_PollEvent` and switches on
  the type. `SDL_KEYDOWN` (`0x156A043`) reads `keysym.sym` (+0x14) and
  `keysym.scancode` (+0x10), maps keypad Enter to Return and passes the key to
  the GUI; `SDL_TEXTINPUT` (`0x303`) decodes the first UTF-8 character and
  passes it on separately. `windowID` is not read.
- A key press is queued as a player's would be: `SDL_KEYDOWN`, then
  `SDL_TEXTINPUT` with its character for keys that have one (no modifiers,
  US layout), then `SDL_KEYUP`. `mod` is 0.
- Keys: pause and resume press Space, speed presses keypad `+` / `-`
  (`KP_PLUS` / `KP_MINUS` are names in the game's key table in
  `keyevent.cpp`). No `.gui` file binds the speed buttons; the bindings are in
  the game's code.

`pause` waits for the player pause byte, `resume` for the game's own "is
paused" answer to become false. `resume` refuses without pressing anything
when the game is paused but the player pause is off: Space would add a
player pause. `speed N` presses one key at a time and waits for each step.

### Live check (2026-10-16)

Original `eu4.exe` (`9AD3EFE1…771A`), Anvil 0.2.0, this branch, Russia save
of 17 March 1719 loaded with `continue=`; the lab's `anvil-play.ps1 -Scenario
tongs -TongsInput`, three sessions (`tongs-input-1` … `-3`). Anvil: all 9
`[[expect]]` ranges matched. Each session ended by the script after checking
PID, path and start time; save unchanged, `settings.txt` differed only in
`graceful_exit` and was restored.

- Space as `SDL_KEYDOWN`/`SDL_KEYUP` alone pauses and resumes; `pause` and
  `resume` reacted within 15–50 ms, `waited_ms` included.
- Speed: `-` sent as `SDL_KEYDOWN`/`SDL_KEYUP` alone did nothing while the
  game ran; with `SDL_TEXTINPUT`, keypad `+` / `-` and `-` change the speed,
  `=` does not. Keypad keys without `SDL_TEXTINPUT` were only tried right
  after loading (see below), so that case is open. `speed 5`, `speed 1`, `speed 3` worked
  paused and running (2–4 presses, 78–281 ms); the pause stayed on.
- With Notepad in the foreground (the game window without focus), `resume`,
  `speed 2` and `pause` worked the same.
- Right after the save loaded (first `in_game: true` with `paused: true`), a
  speed key was handled between 2 and 7 s later, not dropped: the first
  `speed 3` timed out at 2 s, and 5 s later the speed was 3. Key presses sent
  then stack up, so commands wait up to 10 s.
- Esc opened the game menu, which set the player pause; with the menu open,
  Space did not resume (timeout), and a second Esc left the pause on. After
  that, `resume` worked.
- After `pause`, the date may still advance by one day (the day in progress);
  then it stays.

## Not verified yet

- `paused` for pauses not caused by the pause button (event popups that pause,
  menus, multiplayer); `paused_flag` alone was confirmed for the button.
- Behaviour in the main menu and during save loading beyond "not in game".
- Input in the main menu, in text fields (Space types instead of pausing),
  with event popups, and with keyboard layouts other than US (SDL key codes
  and the characters sent follow a US layout).
- Whether the speed keys need `SDL_TEXTINPUT` alone or both events; both are
  sent, as SDL does for a real key.
